🔍 Overview

This project implements a traffic sign detection and recognition system using deep learning architectures (CNN, LeNet, AlexNet) on the GTSRB dataset. It was completed as part of a master's degree coursework.

🎯 Objectives

Classify German traffic signs with high accuracy

Compare the performance of different CNN variants

Apply data augmentation to improve model generalization

Evaluate performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

🧠 Models Used

Custom CNN with Augmentation

LeNet

AlexNet

🙋‍♂️ My Role 

As part of Group 16, my responsibility corresponded to T1 – Descriptive Analysis of the Dataset and Result Analysis.
I was primarily involved in:

🔹 Descriptive Analysis of the Dataset (EDA)

Examined the structure and characteristics of the GTSRB dataset

Performed class distribution analysis to identify imbalances

Visualized sample images from different classes

Analyzed brightness, contrast, and aspect ratio variations

Detected outliers (size-based, brightness-based)

Conducted feature-based analysis such as edge detection

🔹 Result Analysis

Interpreted model performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Compared the strengths and limitations of CNN, LeNet, and AlexNet

Evaluated generalization capability and training/inference trade-offs

Summarized how preprocessing choices and data characteristics impacted results
